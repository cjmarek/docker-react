I have thrown this away. It fails because of the AWS stuff. I got this from 103-finished-gh-actions.zip it is not the correct deploy.yml
If you look at the other .yml file, I don't mention the AWS stuff and that .yml file works.

I got the other deploy.yml file out of 89-touch-gh-actions. But I had to change the - main to say master.
I realized that 103-finished-gh-actions.zip is not the correct deploy.yml for this
project, I was supposed to use 89-touch-gh-actions.zip. That one does not mention the AWS deployment, 
which is what I want since AWS is not set up by me since I don't want to pay for AWS.
