# will load a copy of docker into our running container
services:
  - docker
# run commands before our test run, such as to build the Docker image
before_install:
  - docker build -t fooimageid -f Dockerfile.dev .
# the commands that need to be executed to run the test suite
# the key words -e CI=true, keeps the build progress from hanging 
# on the test run feedback (regarding options you can do). We want travis to proceed
script:
  - docker run -e CI=true fooimageid npm run test
