If you do not wish to use Travis CI, or, you have run out of credits, we have provided code and guidance to use GitHub Actions instead. 
GitHub Actions is a free CI/CD automation tool built directly into GitHub repositories. It eliminates the need for external services.



How do I fire up the GitHub Actions CI/CD automation?
I am not using Travis CI. I was hoping to use GitHub Actions instead. 

I went ahead and followed the lessons regarding Travis CI, since I don't really have a choice.
I wanted to see the Travis CI process play out since I assumed a similar process occurs for GitHub actions. 

I did take the GitHub deploy.yaml from 103-finished-gh-actions.zip and inserted that deploy.yaml into the .github/workflows directory in my repository root.
But when I did a  git push origin master, the build failed??? WTF, then I realized that 103-finished-gh-actions.zip is not the correct deploy.yml for this
project, I was supposed to use 89-touch-gh-actions.zip. That one does not mention the AWS deployment, which is what I want since AWS is not set up by me since
I don't want to pay for AWS.

Are there replacement lessons that walk me through the CI/CD automation tool built directly into GitHub repositories??? Yes there is see....
