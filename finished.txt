If you do not wish to use Travis CI, or, you have run out of credits, we have provided code and guidance to use GitHub Actions instead. 
GitHub Actions is a free CI/CD automation tool built directly into GitHub repositories. It eliminates the need for external services.



How do I fire up the GitHub Actions CI/CD automation?
I am not using Travis CI. I was hoping to use GitHub Actions instead. 

I went ahead and followed the lessons regarding Travis CI, since I don't really have a choice.
I wanted to see the Travis CI process play out since I assumed a similar process occurs for GitHub actions. 
I did take the GitHub deploy.yaml and inserted that deploy.yaml into the .github/workflows directory in my repository root.

Are there replacement lessons that walk me through the CI/CD automation tool built directly into GitHub repositories???
